# Predicting Antidiabetic Activity of Chemical Compounds Using Machine Learning

Diabetes mellitus remains a major global health burden, and the traditional drug discovery process is often slow, costly, and inefficient. In this project, a dataset of 65,000+ compounds from the ChEMBL database was curated and labeled based on IC₅₀ values. We employed three deep learning models to classify compounds as active or inactive:

- Descriptor-based model

- Fingerprint-based model

- Combined dual-input model

The best performance was achieved by the fingerprint-based model with an accuracy of 88.95%, followed by the combined model at 88.79%, and the descriptor model at 81.19%.
